Dr. Evil: The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
Therapist (Carrie Fisher): Oh no, please, please, let's hear about your
childhood.
Dr Evil: Very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly
self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy
and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French
prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize,
he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the
question mark. Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the
sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane
lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In
the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in
a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age
of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian
named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing
like a shorn scrotum, it's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.
Therapist: You know, we have to stop.

[T]he richer tourists at Disney World wear t-shirts printed with the
names of famous designers, because the designs themselves can be
bootlegged easily and with impunity. The only way to make clothing that
cannot be legally bootlegged is to print copyrighted and trademarked
words on it; once you have taken that step the clothing itself doesn't
really matter, and so a t-shirt is as good as anything else. T-shirts
with expensive words on them are now the insignia of the upper class.
T-shirts with cheap words, or no words at all, are for the commoners.

Information Wants To Be Free. Information also wants to be expensive.
Information wants to be free because it has become so cheap to
distribute, copy, and recombine---too cheap to meter. It wants to be
expensive because it can be immeasurably valuable to the recipient. That
tension will not go away. It leads to endless wrenching debate about
price, copyright, 'intellectual property', the moral rightness of casual
distribution, because each round of new devices makes the tension worse,
not better.

I really am amused by this turn of discussion, because advocates of
copyleft are in precisely the same position.  Their *amoral*,
objective analysis of human behavior is that some humans will try to
restrict the software freedom of others, and the vast majority of
those others will see no profit in resisting.  Therefore, a free
software license that *deliberately restricts* licensees' freedom is
carefully designed, a profoundly moral act.

In fact, even in the presence of copyright or patent, an individual
always has the right to choose only software under a free license, at
the cost of giving up proprietary software, thus preserving his own
freedom.  Therefore copyleft, restricting the freedom to bargain away
the "four freedoms" in return for something else of value, can be
justified morally *only* by reference to the software "ecosystem", ie,
emergent effects of your use of non-free software on my freedom.

Kierkegaard presents his pseudonymous authorship as a dialectical
progression of existential stages. The first is the aesthetic...stage
of existence [which] is characterized by the following: immersion
in sensuous experience; valorization of possibility over actuality;
egotism; fragmentation of the subject of experience; nihilistic wielding
of irony and scepticism; and flight from boredom.

My feeling with the bad groups is that coming into office hours, they've
already decided what they're going to do and everything I say is being
put through an internal process in their heads, which either desperately
tries to munge what I've said into something that conforms with their
decision or just outright dismisses it and creates a rationalization
for doing so. They may not even be conscious of this process but that's
what I think is happening when you say something to bad groups and they
have that glazed over look. I don't think it's confusion or lack of
understanding per se, it's this internal process at work.

In particular this query has always come home to me: May not the claims
of tender-mindedness go too far? May not the notion of a world already
saved in toto anyhow, be too saccharine to stand? May not religious
optimism be too idyllic? Must all be saved? Is no price to be paid in
the work of salvation? Is the last word sweet? Is all 'yes, yes' in
the universe? Doesn't the fact of 'no' stand at the very core of life?
Doesn't the very 'seriousness' that we attribute to life mean that
ineluctable noes and losses form a part of it, that there are genuine
sacrifices somewhere, and that something permanently drastic and bitter
always remains at the bottom of its cup?
